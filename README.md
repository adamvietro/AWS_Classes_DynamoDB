# AWS_Classes_DynamoDB
This will help you work with DynamoDB databases

This uses the boto3 lib that can easily be added to your python libs with:

pip instal boto3

With the command line. This was created in order to work with the Path of Exile public API stash. 
I wanted to create a table with all the items from the stash and orgainze it by the ilvl of the 
items and the name of the items. There are helper functions to create unique Ids for the table,
as well as Url decoders inorder to parse the query string parameters that can be used to access
the required information.

Thanks for reading and using my code.
